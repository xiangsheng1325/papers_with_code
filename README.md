# Scalable pattern-based gnn for credit card fraud detection

Step 1: learn how to use dgl for large-scale node classifications

Step 2: re-implement the state-of-the-art pattern-based gnn through *dgl*

Step 3: re-implement the experiment of SOTA

Step 4: Beat SOTA

Step 5: re-implement the state-of-the-art credit card fraud detection method

Step6: re-implement the experiment of fraud detection

Step7: add experiments of fraud detection baselines
